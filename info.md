The given text has several errors in grammar and spelling.

* The word `I` must be capitalized since it is a subject pronoun.
* The word `stupid` should be replaced with `am` to form a complete sentence.
* The word `crazy` should be replaced with `am` to match the verb tense.
* The word `dont` should be replaced with `don't` since it is a contraction.

A corrected version of the text would be:

```
I `am` `crazy` and `don't` speak English.
```

**Example:**

Incorrect: Me hungry want food.
Corrected: `I` am `hungry` and `want` food.

Explanation:
* `I` should be used instead of `me`.
* `Am` should be used to form a complete sentence.
* `Hungry` should be used instead of `want hungry`.
* `Want` can be used to express a desire for food.
